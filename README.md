# Text recognition with Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network and TensorFlow 2.0 (tf2-crnn)

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tf-crnn/badge/?version=latest)](https://tf-crnn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Implementation of a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) for image-based sequence recognition tasks, such as scene text recognition and OCR. 

This implementation is based on Tensorflow 2.0 and uses `tf.keras` and `tf.data` modules to build the model and to handle input data.


## Installation
`tf_crnn` makes use of `tensorflow-gpu` package (so CUDA and cuDNN are needed). 

You can install it using the `environment.yml` file provided and use it within an environment.

See the [docs](https://tf-crnn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/index.html#) for the installation procedures and how to use it.
